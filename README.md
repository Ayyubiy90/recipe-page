## My Process

### 🚀 Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- [Young Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Young+Serif) - Font for headings
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - Font for body
- **Responsive design principles**

### 🌟 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I strengthened my understanding of semantic HTML and responsive design. Here are some code snippets that I am particularly proud of:

```html
<div class="container">
  <header>
    <img src="./assets/images/image-omelette.jpeg" alt="Recipe Header Image" class="header-image">
    <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
  </header>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 1440px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
  background-color: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

### 🔄 Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to further refine my skills in:

- **Advanced CSS techniques**: such as animations and transitions
- **JavaScript integration**: to add interactivity to static pages
- **Accessibility (WCAG standards)**: to ensure my sites are usable for everyone

### 📚 Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A great reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This site helped me understand Flexbox and Grid layouts more deeply.
